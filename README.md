# Intelligent Kernel
Implementing machine learning  to the most essential part of the computers (operating system). using machine learning C libraries like darknet. main aim is to analyse the possiblity to  work on diffrent aspects of  kernel and systems programming to make the linux kernel ahead in race wrt their closed source counter-parts.

# kernel optimization

1.  analysing the process metrics and then tuning the operation of the operating system correspondingly has been the main concern  for the  system admins , thus making a ML engine that will automatically throttle the required performance  by  aiding the scheduler will be the swiss knife for the  system programmers .
  - [ ]  getting the dataset and understanding the pain points of the kernel programming <br>
        -  its essential to improve the process , not to make it more worse by just saying that we have done something novel
  
  - [ ]  getting used to using C  for making machine learning models ðŸ¤£ . 
  
  - [ ] starting with our analysis of paper of Kernel tuning :- KernTune - Yi_Linux_kernel_optimization.pdf
  
  - [ ] then try to work on [the next level](https://docs.kali.org/development/recompiling-the-kali-linux-kernel) and optimise         the kali linux
